Welcome to the all-in-one System Update and maintenance   
assistant app.                                        
                                                       
                                                       
 This simple script will automatically         	     
 
 - refresh your packagelist, 
 - download and install updates (if there are any),
 - remove any old kernels that came from updates,
 - remove obsolete packages and their configuration files to free up disk space

 without any need of user interference                                           
                   				                     
Also, if you started with a parameter (-u, -d) it will
check for the next available release and start the    
upgrade. 

For usage start ucaresystem-core with '-h' parameter :

    sudo ucaresystem-core -h
